You know I gotcha
You know that
I got you like that
Ain't nobody gonna
have your back
like the way I do
You love it just say you do
You know you got me
Everything you do
Everything you did
Everything I wish I was with
Makes me feel alright
I'm just saying so
I really like it
Nothing in the world
can make me feel
the way you do the things you do
I really like it
Nothing in the world
can make me feel
the way you do the things you do
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
Look at you now look at me
How you ever ever gonna find
someone like this
Look at you now look at me
How you ever ever gonna find
someone like this
You're the reason
my heart skips drops
Just a little touch
my world stops
Finally I know that you're mine
I don't want to fall
Don't wanna play
this game of love oh eh oh
There's nowhere to hide
I really like it
Nothing in the world
can make me feel
the way you do the things you do
I really like it
Nothing in the world
can make me feel
the way you do the things you do
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
Look at you now look at me
How you ever ever gonna find
someone like this
Look at you now look at me
How you ever ever gonna find
someone like this
Under the moonlight
All in the mood like
You should put a ring on it
I do I do vibes
Don't get the blue light
We getting nasty
I found my new ride
Here in the backseat
Love so good
I bet he be cashing out
I got him feeling that rush
like he passing out
Couldn't handle these curves
so he crashing now
Beep beep with the way
I can back it out
I love you and me
I love you and me
I love you and me
